Glutaugenpilz 0.1 by pjaako
Glutaugenpilz measures a CPU coolerâ€™s max sustained heat dissipation in the following way:
It manipulates the CPUs PPT limit and then measures the stabilized temperature of the CPU
under a heavy load that makes sure the CPU is working at PPT. Current package power is tracked as well.
If the temperature stabilizes at a value below a given threshold, the CPU cooler is able to dissipate more heat than
the CPU is producing. Then the PPT limit is increased and the test is repeated.
If the temperature stays above the threshold for a given time, the CPU cooler is not able to dissipate all 
the heat produced by the CPU. The PPT limit is decreased and the test is repeated.
At the end of the test, the sweet spot package power is found where the CPU temperature is slightly below the threshold.
Given that Package power directly correlates with steady state temperature, optimum can be found with fewer steps 
Use a binary search or similar algorithm.
The script relies on ZenStates Core to manipulate the PPT limit and therefore is suitable for AMD Ryzen CPUs only.
